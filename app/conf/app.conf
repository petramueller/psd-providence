# Each replacement consists of a key (basically a name), a list of "search" regular expressions
# (usually 1) and a list of "replace" patterns. Both lists must have the same length, i.e. there must
# be a "replace" pattern for each search regular expression. For more information on the syntax,
# please refer to the documentation for preg_replace.
# Note that the media importer will try to mach the results of these replacements to CollectiveAccess
